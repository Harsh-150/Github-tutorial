pushing local repository on github

1. git remote add origin <url of github repository> --> to connect to repository
2. git push -u origin main --> to push into repository


if you get any error:

The “error: src refspec main does not match any” message occurs when Git can’t find a branch named “main” to push to. 
Here are a couple of solutions:

Check Your Branch Name:
Verify that your local branch is named “main.” If it’s actually named “master,” 
you’ll need to adjust your commands accordingly.
To push with the correct name, use:
git push -u origin master

Rename Your Local Branch:
If you want to use the “main” branch, rename your local branch:
git branch -m main

Then push your changes to the remote “main” branch:
git push -u origin main

Handling Unrelated Histories:
If you encounter issues after renaming, try pulling from the remote repository:
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories

Then push again:
git push -u origin main
